# 01CodeRefactor
My goal with this code refactor was to make the website SEO compatible and provide accessible alt attributes. I also worked on cleaning up the HTML file and the CSS style paage. I corrected some errors with the page navigation. I also worked on updating the code to have semantic HTML5 elements.
